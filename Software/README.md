A library for use the board with Microsoft Bascom (Basic compiler) and Fortran-80.
I have test it under CPM Plus.

Usage :

1_ compile library sources (after adjusting the FPU address into am9511.mac)
m80 = am9511.mac/L --> am9511.rel
m80 =apu.mac/L --> apu.rel

2_ create the library
lib80 libapu.rel=am9511.rel,apu.rel/e --> libapu.rel

3_ compile a basic test program
bascom =aputst.bas/o/l --> aputst.rel

4 link with or without the library (for use ou not the fpu)
(with) l80 aputst.rel,libapu.rel,aputst.com/n/y/e
or (without) l80 aputst.rel,aputst.com/n/y/e --> aputst.com

and check speed improvment !

There is some warnings about double definitions but works well...
